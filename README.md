# THESEUS: A Routing System for Shared Sensor Networks
THESEUS is an energy-efficient routing system for Shared Sensor Networks (SSNs), with the primary goal of extending the network lifetime. THESEUS has two features that distinguish it from other works found in the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and Shared Sensor Network (SSN) literature. First, it saves energy of SSN nodes by using a packet aggregation algorithm, which reduces the number of transmissions. Second, THESEUS balances energy usage in the whole SSN thanks to its dynamic, QoS and energy aware route selection algorithms. Such energy usage balancing avoids network partitioning due to the energy depletion of some more extensively used nodes. Both features of THESEUS result in prolonging the SSN lifetime. Experiments were performed with the purpose of evaluating THESEUS effectiveness for improving the SSNs lifetime. Furthermore, THESEUS supports multiple sink nodes, thus it is able to adjust routes whenever a sink node is added or removed, dynamically. The conducted evaluation shows significant improvements in the energy usage and the energy balance metrics, compared to the related work in the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) literature.
